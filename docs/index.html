<p>Data Fence is a Data Warehouse Security Management tool which helps database
administrators keep data warehouse permissions stable, repeatable and easy to manage.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Repeat the same security configuration across multiple environments.</li>
  <li>Automatically heal configuration drift by revoking undesired grants and granting 
  missing grants. This is a significant problem in SQL based data warehouses which have 
  stateful implicit behavior resulting from behavior such as creating objects and 
  dropping objects.</li>
  <li>Scale to manage millions of grants on hundreds of thousands of objects. Terraform 
  chokes on the scale of data warehouse grants.</li>
  <li>Gracefully handle the transient existance of objects controlled outside of the security 
  infrastructure.</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, Data Fence only supports the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/">Snowflake</a> data 
warehouse. However, with enough community support, it can support additional data 
warehouses in the future.</p>

<p>While Data Fence can be run at deploy time like other continuous deployment tools, 
we have found that it works best when you run it on a schedule so that it is continuously 
analyzing the grants in the warehouse, revoking undesired grants and granting missing 
grants.</p>
